I'm serving on the Governor's Task Force for the Recruitment and Retention of a Young Workforce for New Hampshire. A number of thoughts have occurred to me through this process that I think are interesting. It should be noted that these are my opinions only and in no way represent the feelings of the Task Force or Governor Lynch.

#### What I've Learned So Far

Through the information that's been shared, there are a number of facts (as far as statistics go) that have impressed me

Young professionals (20s-30s) are not moving out of the state in mass exodus. The demographic is shrinking due to a lack of minority population.

Young professionals really can't all be lumped into one group. It really is divided into three groups:

- The people just graduating high school. (18-20)
- College students, recent graduates and young singles (20-30)
- Couples with kids

The place where we are strongest in terms of recruitment and retention is the third category.

Our lack of minority population is a distinct disadvantage compared to other regions of the country. The stat that said a lot to me was that for every 1 white, non-hispanic death, 1.3 white non-hispanic baby is born. For every 1 hispanic death, 8 hispanic babies are born. This represents a statistically younger hispanic population.

I'll follow this with some other observations as we continue our work. Interesting stuff.
