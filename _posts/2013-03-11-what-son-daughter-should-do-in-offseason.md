So it’s the time of the year when teams wind down, we spring the clocks forward and things begin to turn green. This year, in particular, I’ve been asked quite a bit about spring tournament teams and what’s best for development during the off-season. I’ll confine my comments to Peewees headed into Bantams and younger as high school players need to be a bit more focused. Note that I’m talking about the AAA level.

### Take some time away from the rink!

First and perhaps most important, get away from the rink for a bit. Private lessons year round lead to burn out. Remember, you’re trying to keep your child hungry for the game. If you gave the same candy every single night after dinner, there’s a good chance your kid would lose the obsession for that candy. Play soccer, go fishing, enjoy the sunshine and recharge the batteries. After a few weeks, it’ll be time to pick up the skates again and get back on the ice.

### Go to a good skills camp.

Work on skills at a good, concentrated camp, preferably outside your region. For my own son, we head to Canada for a few weeks each summer to attend a specialized camp, even when we lived in New England. In that three weeks time, he gets 60 hours of on-ice skills work to  focus specifically on learning. If a hockey season is 20 weeks long with three hours of practices per week, that summer camp is equal to an entire season of practices with some of the best coaches he sees all year. Even if you do only one week, that’s a third of a season of practices concentrated into a week of eating, sleeping and breathing hockey.

The purpose of heading outside your region is to experience hockey priorities “foreign” to your own area. In New England, it’s a bit more on passing and physical play. In the DC area, high emphasis is placed on puck handling. In Ontario, it’s scoring and skating (at least where we go).

### Consider focusing on a specific area in camp.

If your child is seriously how to improve his game, look at targeted areas for improvement. First year bantams is an ideal year to head to a “checking” camp that emphasizes body position, angling and body checking. At the goalie camp we attend, they offer a goal scoring camp for skaters where players are paired with a major junior or professional player to learn how to beat a goalie, shooting over 1000 pucks per day. Of course, every player can improve on their power skating.

### Extended summer development programs keep skills sharp.

Programs like the Little Capitals Player Development sessions keep skills sharp through the summer through competition with other highly skilled players. The commitment is relatively light and the focus is on skills rather than system which helps a player truly develop week after week.

### Spring/Summer tournament teams are for FUN.

Spring teams are great for kids to have fun with other friends. They are not  nearly as effective as the camps and clinics for player development. Here’s why…

Spring Tournament Team Ice Time

- Each game is roughly 45 minutes of game time.
- In a given game, a player gets roughly 1/3 of the shifts or 15 minutes of ice time.
- 2 tournaments x 4 games = 8 total games.
- 8 games x 15 minutes of ice time = a total of 2 hours ice time.
- Let’s add in another hour of ice for practice…3 total hours of ice time. (This doesn’t even take into account the amount of time the puck is on a player’s stick which may be a total of 2 minutes per game).

> So here’s the question…how much did those tournaments cost in fuel + hotel + meals + tuition? Now let’s look at a camp:

### Summer Camp

- 4 hours of ice per day.
- Players are on for the entire 4 hours working on specific target areas. This doesn’t even include dryland training during the day.
- Assuming a five day camp, 20 hours of ice time in five days.
- No travel required

> Comparison: 3 hours vs. 20 hours. No comparison. 

Please note that I’m not saying that Spring tournament teams are a bad thing. I’m only saying that their best purpose is to have fun with friends as the instructional time is radically reduced compared to a camp that would likely cost less.
