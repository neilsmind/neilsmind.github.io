I am always amazed at coincidence that makes you think long and hard (in a positive way) about divine guidance.

Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of meeting [Bob Bigelow](http://www.bobbigelow.com), author of [Just Let the Kids Play](http://www.bobbigelow.com/just-let-the-kids-play.htm), and experiencing his presentation about long term player development. (Incidentally, I finally found a movement that corresponds with my own madness; I’ve been an advocate of long term player development at the expense of short term wins for more than ten years).

The coincidence was that following the event, I began reading Bob’s book and who is the first person listed in the credits? [Doug Abrams](http://www.momsteam.com/douglas-e-abrams) - my hockey camp goalie coach circa 1984-1986. Doug Abrams - my favorite goalie coach of all time and the guy who wrote me my first letter of recommendation so I could be a camp counselor at the same hockey school two years later.

As it turns out, Doug Abrams is also a noted expert on the subject of long term player development in youth sports. I had no idea that Doug and I shared the same philosophy of coaching but it does make sense given my affection for him as a young goalie. I’m thrilled to make this connection and to be further enriched by him with his connection to all things positive coaching. I’ll be sharing some things I learn along the away and hopefully some information that I find through Doug.
