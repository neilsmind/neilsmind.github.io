For me, naming a captain is not so much me (or the team) choosing someone and saying he/she is the new leader of the team. It’s a matter of observing the natural behavior of the team and identifying who the team naturally respects (and for the right reasons).

I’m not a big fan of the team electing captains, particularly at the youth level. In part, the players don’t yet know what a captain does or can’t identify the traits that make up a good one. It often turns into a popularity contest in voting. That said, I let the players choose…I just don’t tell them how:

Each season, we hold a pre-season team building event. I’ve found that ropes courses work best. A professional facilitator runs the day and the coaches come along but they can’t talk, just observe. It’s one of the most frustration and educational experiences with his team a coach will have.

I watch as each challenge is presented to the team to see who demands the attention vs. who naturally gains through respect. Typically the day begins with a lot of shouting as kids jockey for position as the alpha. Often, a quieter kid will hang back and consider the situation, wait his turn to speak to the team and then engage them all together. It’s pretty amazing to see the dynamic. Regardless, if you watch 3-4 of the challenges unfold, it’s pretty easy to see who is the leader that others follow combined with who respects his followers.

At the day’s conclusion, the coaches (now able to speak) talk through with the players how the day went, what they learned and help the kids to articulate their successes. The coaches finish by revealing the captain + alternates and why. Pay particular attention to explaining how the kids themselves identified the captains. Also, emphasize that everyone is a leader.
