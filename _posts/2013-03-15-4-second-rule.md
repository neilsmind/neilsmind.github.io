So I was speaking yesterday with a parent considering bringing her child to the program where I'm coaching. We had a great chat about her son, the mechanics of how our program works, etc. At the end of the call, she said she had one more question (and seemed to have some trepidation asking)..."Is it true that you have a 4 second rule?"

I had a smile from ear to ear.

I proceeded to give her a bit of background of what that meant and why we used it. When I came to help the team in November of this past season, they (like many/most PeeWee hockey teams) didn't pass enough. It's easy to chalk that kind of thing up to kids being selfish and certainly there can be some of that. In my experience, passing typically just hasn't been something ingrained in their young hockey minds.

Most of our kids were the best player on every team they ever played. When they were younger, everyone in the arena adored as they skated through the lesser skilled players and put the biscuit in the basket. As they grew older and they moved up to AAA, they followed the same patterns they followed as the superstar previously. The problem is that they couldn't skate through everyone anymore. Their adoration became a bit of resentment. Take an entire team of those kids and you have most AAA hockey teams at the PeeWee age level and we were no different.

In order to break that pattern, we began by playing a game with a soccer ball that is a cross between team handball and frisbee football. We call it  Tiger Ball. The kids are divided into two teams; one zone of the ice is set up as the "field" with end zones marked off by cones on each side. One player begins with the ball and he must stand still. He passes to a teammate to progress up the field. The receiver must stop when he catches the ball and he becomes the next "Quarterback." If the ball hits the ice, the other team takes possession at that spot. Primarily, the game is for teaching the concept of "close support" such that long passes don't tend to work and players getting open is paramount.

In the case of this team, we started with just normal rules. After a bit, we added a "2 second rule" where the receiving player had to move the ball to the next teammate within two seconds. (Four seconds is actually a lifetime in a fast moving game like hockey). This forced the players to not only get open but, more importantly, actively identify options before they received the pass. Otherwise, there's no way they complete a pass in time and the ball turns over to the other team at that spot. Tempo picks up, kids  start thinking, their vision of the ice moves from five feet around them to the entire ice...it's a beautiful thing.

When the game ends, we bring 'em in and talk about what works and doesn't work in that scenario. We then talk about how that works in hockey. "Know your options", "Support the puck carrier", etc.

Now we move the concept to a small area game with a puck cross ice. For the latter half of the season, we began using the "2 second rule" for all of our scrimmage games. What happened from there? Goal production increased and, just as importantly, multiple assist goals increased. They really started to get it in the last part of the season and the team demonstrated they could play with anyone and move the puck at the same time.

Bottom line behind the rule is that sometimes artificial constraints can and should used to guide young players to make good choices and change their way of thinking. Loved the question and I'm glad word is getting out that things are changing at WLC.
