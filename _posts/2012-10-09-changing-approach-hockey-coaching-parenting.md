**So here’s the thing. I’ve had tens if not hundreds of topics rattling around in my head to blog about for nearly 10 years.**

They mostly revolve around youth sports and coaching. Many of them are directly hockey related but many more are about youth sports in general. Positive coaching, tactics, systems, teaching discipline and self-sacrifice, being a parent with a young athlete and more.

#### So…why haven’t I blogged about most ANY of them?

Because I’m perpetually concerned about appearing condescending or pompous. I know I don’t have all the answers (if any if any of them) and I actively look to learn more about the game, my role in it (coach and parent) and myself. I’m always a bit concerned about being preachy

#### So why write at all?

I know in my heart there are things that I wish I would have known…that someone would have shared with me when I was coming up as a coach and then, later, as a parent of young children playing sports.

#### Finding my voice

I finally discovered my voice and it came, to a degree, from a parent of a child on the first team I ever coached. His name was Paul Yorkdale and his son Gary played for me. I never knew Paul that well and he never really approached me. I was a 21 year old, first time head coach for what today would be known as a Bantam AA team. I was clueless. I had played for most of my life but I never really knew what it took to coach.

I ran practices that I thought would make the team better. We did basically two things.

1. We skated…a LOT. We did ladder drills and lightning drills. We did herbies. My first practice we didn’t even bring the pucks on the ice until half the practice was over.
When we weren’t doing sprints, we worked on systems. We spent eons on the breakout. Every practice.
1. We played our first month of games and my frustration grew. They just weren’t “getting it” regarding the breakout. They clearly weren’t listening. So…we skated some more and we did breakout drills some more.

#### Then something happened

One night after practice, Mr. Yorkdale (I was 21 years old so he was Mr. Yorkdale to me) quietly handed me an envelope and asked me to read it later. No pomp and circumstance…just a quiet request.

I read his letter. First, he could not have been more humble in his suggestions to me. He thanked me for coaching his son and commended me on my willingness to volunteer my time. Then he shared with me something I hadn’t realized myself (which I now take for granted)…

> Players will never be successful executing a system if they haven’t mastered the skills required.

I was teaching a breakout, over and over, to boys who had, in many cases, never mastered passing the puck. They, in some cases, hadn’t necessarily mastered the skating skills required to move to a position to receive a pass.

#### That changed everything.

As a coach, this changed everything for me. Having my eyes opened (even a little) to the necessity for a progression from skills to tactics to systems showed me I had a LOT to learn about *teaching* kids. The thing about it was that it was Mr. Yorkdale’s approach that really helped it hit home for me. He wasn’t lecturing me (even though I was clearly the student here)…he was sharing from his experience something I needed to know. It started for me an unquenchable, burning desire to learn more about how to teach, motivate and develop children playing hockey.

Moving back to this blog, it wasn’t until I recently once again reflected on that experience (which I’ve thought of often) that it occurred to me…this is the voice I was looking for.

This blog will be my way to pay that kind gesture forward in whatever knowledge and experience I’ve obtained. From here forward, **this blog will be my observations as "the things I wish someone would have told me"** (or the things someone did tell me but others might want to know).

Finally, thank you to Mr. Yorkdale. You never knew it (and I’m not sure I ever thanked you),  but you were an inspiration to me. It’s been my great pleasure to hopefully touch the lives of more than a few boys and girls over the past 20 years in coaching. The first spark of wanting to be a better coach was thanks to a humble letter that you gave me and no one ever really knew about. Thank you.

One final note: I had no idea how humble in regard to Mr. Yorkdale I should have been [until today](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=31644457).
